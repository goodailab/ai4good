## Our Mission
The AI4G Lab works on AI-driven approaches for applications in eco-coservation, biomedical imaging and science.

Key areas of research include:

**Geometric AI**: Leveraging Riemannian geometry, topological spaces, and latent manifold analysis for feature representation and learning.
**Multimodal Learning**: Developing AI systems that process and fuse diverse data sources for tasks like classification, re-identification, and tracking.
**Adaptive Intelligence**: Creating models capable of dynamic adaptation to new data, environments, and unseen tasks.
